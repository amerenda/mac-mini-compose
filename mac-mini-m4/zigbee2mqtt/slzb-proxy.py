slzb-proxy v5 — TCP keep-alive proxy for SLZB-06MG24 with drain + timeout

Background: SLZB-OS 3.3.1 "reboot EFR32 at startup" wiped the EFR32's NVM.
EFR32 firmware 8.0.2 b397 has a bug where NVM token writes trigger
RESET_SOFTWARE at runtime ~7-8s after "Zigbee2MQTT started!". This is the
EmberZNet NVM save timer firing and writing configuration tokens to flash,
which causes a spontaneous EFR32 soft reset.

Root cause of crash loop:
  coordinator_backup.json frame_counter > EFR32's current frame counter after
  each crash-reset causes herdsman to restore the high counter via EZSP, which
  dirties an NVM token, which the NVM save timer writes 7-8s later →
  RESET_SOFTWARE → crash → repeat. Fix: keep coordinator_backup.json
  frame_counter=0 so herdsman never writes a frame counter to EFR32 (EFR32
  always has counter >= 0, so no write is needed).

What this proxy fixes (3 failure modes):

1. HOST_FATAL_ERROR on new connection — stale RSTACK data accumulates in
   the SLZB TCP receive buffer while Z2M is crashed. When Z2M reconnects,
   _slzb_to_client reads and forwards the stale RSTACK before Z2M has even
   sent RST, causing immediate HOST_FATAL_ERROR. Fix: drain (discard) data
   from the SLZB socket during the post-disconnect hold period (drain-only
   mode: SLZB TCP connection is kept alive; no cycling).

2. _slzb_to_client hangs forever — if Z2M crashes with ASH_ERROR_TIMEOUTS
   (adapter sent no data), _slzb_to_client is blocked on recv() with no
   data coming, so session.run() never returns and the hold/drain loop
   never starts. Fix: use select() with a timeout in _slzb_to_client so
   it can check _stop and exit promptly.

3. Stale-connection churn — during the drain period Z2M crashes and restarts
   multiple times. The OS queues these stale TCP connections in the backlog.
   When the drain ends and the proxy calls accept(), it gets a stale CLOSE_WAIT
   connection that immediately returns EOF, triggering another unnecessary drain
   cycle. Fix: track session duration; sessions < MIN_REAL_SESSION_DURATION are
   stale and skipped (no drain started).

Root cause that STILL requires an EFR32 firmware update:
  - SET_CONFIGURATION_VALUE commands from herdsman during init dirty NVM tokens.
    EmberZNet's NVM save timer fires ~7-8s after init completes and writes those
    tokens to flash. EFR32 firmware 8.0.2 b397 sends RESET_SOFTWARE when writing
    NVM (known bug), crashing Z2M. This NVM write is INDEPENDENT of the
    coordinator_backup.json frame_counter. Burn-in (repeated cycles) may
    eventually converge if writes succeed before RESET_SOFTWARE, but the 8.0.2
    b397 bug may prevent convergence entirely.
  - Fix: update EFR32 coordinator firmware via http://10.100.20.179 → Settings →
    Firmware update → Flash latest Zigbee coordinator firmware. Try dev builds if
    no newer stable build is available.

# allows Z2M to connect to a stable EFR32.
